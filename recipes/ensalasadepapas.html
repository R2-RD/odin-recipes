        <li><h3>Prepare the onion</h3></li>
        Mince the onion, add vinegar and let it rest until it's time to mix with the rest of the ingredients (at least 10 minutes). Discard the vinegar.

        Mix potatoes, carrots, eggs, apple, onion, corn, and peas. Add mayonnaise and mix. Season with salt to taste.
