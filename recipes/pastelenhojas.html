        <li>12 leaves parchmentpaper</li>
        <li>Twine, string used for food</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3><p>To make Filling</p></h3></li>
        <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Cook meat</strong></p>
        In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-low heat. Stir in onion and cook and stir until it turns translucent. Add garlic and cook and stir for a minute.
        Add minced meat and cook and stir, breaking it into small clumps until it browns.</li>
        <li><p><strong>Season</strong></p>
        Pour in tomato sauce. Add bell pepper, salt, and pepper. Stir and cover. Simmer for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li><p><strong>Add extra ingredient</strong></p>
        Uncover and mix in an optional ingredient of your choice, or none at all if you so prefer.
        Taste and season with salt and pepper to taste if needed. Remove from the heat. </li>
        </ol>
         <li><h3><p>Making the batter</p></h3></li>
         By hand: Grate the plantain, yautía, and auyama with the least coarse side of the grater. Once grated, combine all the ingredients for the batter and mix well.
        Or with blender/food processor: Chop the plantain, yautía, and auyama, and combine them with the rest of the ingredients for the batter.
        Pureé in a strong blender or a food processor until it's uniform, and you can't feel any clumps, but feels like grains of sand in it. It may take 5-10 minutes, depending on the blender/processor.
        <li><h3>Wrapping pasteles</h3></li>
        Put 2.5 tablespoons of the plantain and root mixture on one of the plantain squares. Put 2 tablespoons of filling in the center, cover with 2 more tablespoons of the root mixture to cover the filling.
        Fold the leaf square in the shape of an envelope. Wrap again in parchment paper and tie tightly.
        Repeat with the remaining batter.
        <li><h3>Boiling pasteles en hoja</h3></li>
        When all are wrapped, bring one gallon of water to boil in a large pot over medium heat. Add a tablespoon of salt.
        When the water reaches a rolling boil, carefully lower the pasteles into the water.
        Cover and cook for 40 minutes. The pasteles will float when put into the water, but as they cook, they'll start to puff and sink. Make sure to turn them a couple of times during the cooking time, so they cook uniformly on all sides.
        Once the 40 minutes have passed, remove one from the liquid, unwrap, and check for doneness: the consistency of the batter will have changed throughout.
        <li><h3>Serving</h3></li>
        If it's ready, remove all from the water, otherwise boil for another 10 minutes.
        Serve right after unwrapping, garnished with hot sauce and/or ketchup.
